This is normally used when the player left-clicks an entity while in spectator mode.\n\nThe player's camera will move with the entity and look where it is looking. The entity is often another player, but can be any type of entity. The player is unable to move this entity (move packets will act as if they are coming from the other entity).\n\nIf the given entity is not loaded by the player, this packet is ignored. To return control to the player, send this packet with their entity ID.\n\nThe vanilla server resets this (sends it back to the default entity) whenever the spectated entity is killed or the player sneaks, but only if they were spectating an entity. It also sends this packet whenever the player switches out of spectator mode (even if they weren't spectating an entity).\n\nThe vanilla client also loads certain shaders for given entities:",

        "notes": "Sets the center position of the client's chunk loading area. The area is square-shaped, spanning 2 \u00d7 server view distance + 7 chunks on both axes (width, not radius!). Since the area's width is always an odd number, there is no ambiguity as to which chunk is the center.\n\nThe vanilla client never renders or simulates chunks located outside the loading area, but keeps them in memory (unless explicitly unloaded by the server while still in range), and only automatically unloads a chunk when another chunk is loaded at coordinates congruent to the old chunk's coordinates modulo (2 \u00d7 server view distance + 7). This means that a chunk may reappear after leaving and later re-entering the loading area through successive uses of this packet, unless it is replaced in the meantime by a different chunk in the same \"slot\".\n\nThe vanilla client ignores attempts to load or unload chunks located outside the loading area. This applies even to unloads targeting chunks that are still loaded, but currently located outside the loading area (per the previous paragraph).\n\nThe vanilla server does not rely on any specific behavior for chunks leaving the loading area, and custom clients need not replicate the above exactly. A client may instead choose to immediately unload any chunks outside the loading area, to use a different modulus, or to ignore the loading area completely and keep chunks loaded regardless of their location until the server requests to unload them. Servers aiming for maximal interoperability should always explicitly unload any loaded chunks before they go outside the loading area.\n\nThe center chunk is normally the chunk the player is in, but apart from the implications on chunk loading, the (vanilla) client takes no issue with this not being the case. Indeed, as long as chunks are sent only within the default loading area centered on the world origin, it is not necessary to send this packet at all. This may be useful for servers with small bounded worlds, such as minigames, since it ensures chunks never need to be resent after the client has joined, saving on bandwidth.\n\nThe vanilla server sends this packet whenever the player moves across a chunk border horizontally, and also (according to testing) for any integer change in the vertical axis, even if it doesn't go across a chunk section border.",

Picking up an item with the mouse actually deletes the item from the server, and placing an item into a slot or dropping it out of the inventory actually tells the server to create the item from scratch. (This can be verified by clicking an item that you don't mind deleting, then severing the connection to the server; the item will be nowhere to be found when you log back in.) As a result of this implementation strategy, the \"Destroy Item\" slot is just a client-side implementation detail that means \"I don't intend to recreate this item.\". Additionally, the long listings of items (by category, etc.) are a client-side interface for choosing which item to create. Picking up an item from such listings sends no packets to the server; only when you put it somewhere does it tell the server to create the item in that location.\n\nThis action can be described as \"set inventory slot\". Picking up an item sets the slot to item ID -1. Placing an item into an inventory slot sets the slot to the specified item. Dropping an item (by clicking outside the window) effectively sets slot -1 to the specified item, which causes the server to spawn the item entity, etc.. All other inventory slots are numbered the same as the non-creative inventory (including slots for the 2x2 crafting menu, even though they aren't visible in the vanilla client).",

The Cursor Position X will be higher if the player was pointing near the right (east) edge of the face, lower if pointing near the left. The Cursor Position Y will be used to determine whether it will appear as a bottom slab (values 0.0\u20130.5) or as a top slab (values 0.5-1.0). The Cursor Position Z should be 1.0 since the player was looking at the southernmost part of the block.\n\nInside block is true when a player's head (specifically eyes) are inside of a block's collision. In 1.13 and later versions, collision is rather complicated and individual blocks can have multiple collision boxes. For instance, a ring of vines has a non-colliding hole in the middle. This value is only true when the player is directly in the box. In practice, though, this value is only used by scaffolding to place in front of the player when sneaking inside of it (other blocks will place behind when you intersect with them -- try with glass for instance).",
