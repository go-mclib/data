# Generate Go Bindings

This folder contains the server reports, as generated by [vanilla_server_reports](../../../vanilla_server_reports), which you can use to generate the Go bindings.

## Generating JSON Reports

You need to generate the JSON reports first, so you can use them to generate the Go bindings.

Note that due to possible legal issues (and also to keep the repo size smaller), the JSON files are not committed in the repo. For local development, you can generate the reports by running the following command:

```bash
./generate.sh
```

inside the [vanilla_server_reports](../../../vanilla_server_reports/) folder.

Then, you can generate the Go bindings: `go generate ./...` (in the root path of this README file)

## Files

- `blocks.json`: Each block and state enumerations mapped to their protocol ID. Used in unit tests to verify that the protocol ID of block states can be correctly calculated;
- `items.json`: Each item in the game and its components;
- `registries.json`: All registries in the base game and their protocol IDs;
